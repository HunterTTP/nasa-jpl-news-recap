{"summary": "ULXs were first identified in the 1970s as a new class of X-ray-emitting objects. But it wasn\u2019t until the early 2000s, with the advent of more powerful X-ray telescopes, that astronomers realized just how bright some of these objects could be.\n\nResearchers have been working to understand how ULXs can get around the Eddington limit. One possibility is that ULXs are beacons for binary star systems, in which a dense, compact star called a neutron star or a black hole orbits a much larger, less dense star. If the two objects are close enough, material from the larger star can fall toward the smaller one, forming an accretion disk. As the infalling material spirals toward the compact star, it heats up, emitting X-rays.\n\nIn the new study, astronomers used NuSTAR to observe ULX M82 X-2, located in the nearby galaxy M82. This ULX is one of the best-studied objects of its kind, and it\u2019s thought to be a binary system with a black hole accreting material from a nearby star.\n\nThe researchers found that the X-rays coming from M82 X-2 are more energetic than previously thought, which means the object is even brighter than scientists had realized. The new observations also showed that the X-rays are emitted in a very focused beam, rather than in all directions as previously thought.
